## Open

### 2026-05-08 — Step 5 register-correct rewrite pass (project-editorial)

Commits `96e221d`, `91b8910`, `f470a11`, `aad5c7d`, `09637ed`, `ad88bc3`, `1868a20`, `e7b14c3`, `11d617a` across two sessions.

**Complete:**
- 4 high-urgency architecture/governance EN+ES pairs rewritten (compounding-substrate,
  doorman-protocol, ontological-governance, leapfrog-2030-architecture) — `96e221d`
- 3 services EN+ES pairs rewritten (service-slm, service-email, service-fs-architecture) — `91b8910`
- 124 files: frontmatter bug (## headings inside YAML block) — batch fixed in `f470a11`
- 19 files: `{{gli|X}}` template markup — batch replaced with plain term in `f470a11`
- 5 Master Totebox Orchestration TOPIC EN+ES pairs published (totebox-orchestration-development,
  pairing-as-permission, os-orchestration, totebox-session, personnel-permissions) — `aad5c7d`,
  `09637ed`, `ad88bc3`
- 1 governance EN+ES pair published (favicon-matrix) — `1868a20`
- **12 services-remaining EN+ES pairs refined** (service-people, service-extraction, service-search,
  message-courier, service-business-clustering, service-places-filtering, fs-anchor-emitter,
  service-fs-security-compliance, service-fs-data-lake, service-slm-totebox-sysadmin,
  template-ledger, pointsav-gis-engine) — `e7b14c3` + `11d617a`

**Open — applications category:** app-mediakit-knowledge, app-mediakit-marketing,
app-orchestration-gis, and others (Step 5 priority 4c)

**Open — GUIDEs (~72 files):** Step 5 priority 5

**Open — category migration:** root topic-*.md files → category subdirectories
(unblocked 2026-05-07 ratification). Tracked in existing open entry below.

**Open — competitor-name violation in zero-container-inference.md:** "What this rules out"
section names Cloud Run, Kubernetes, SkyPilot, cargo-chef explicitly. Workspace §6
prohibits competitive comparisons by name. Surfaced via Phase 3 of 2026-05-08 session;
not actioned in scope. Replace with generic categories (managed container orchestration
platforms, container runtime systems, multi-cloud abstraction frameworks, OCI image
registries) at next editorial pass.

Stage 6 promotions pending across 9 commits — flag to Master at session close.

### 2026-05-06 — BIM batch: 5 EN+ES TOPIC pairs committed (project-editorial)

Commit `c6d233d` — `reference/bim-token-what-it-is.md`, `bim-token-three-layers.md`, `open-bim-regulatory-acceptance.md` + pairs; `architecture/building-design-system-bim.md`, `city-code-as-composable-geometry.md` + pairs.

**Open:** `guide-climate-zone-tokens.md` — commit 9e6d311 on `cluster/project-language` was lost when project-language renamed to project-editorial (commit 7876f28). Source draft is intact at `clones/project-bim/.agent/drafts-outbound/guide-climate-zone-tokens.draft.md` and has been routed to project-editorial inbox. NEXT.md has delivery item.

### 2026-05-06 — Body H1 batch remediation (project-editorial)

103 files fixed via batch script — duplicate body H1 removed from all category articles with foundry-doc-v1 frontmatter.

**Open — `infrastructure/guide-telemetry.md`:** starts with H1 + no frontmatter; Woodfine-specific operational content. Decision needed: (a) normalize as wiki article, (b) move to woodfine-fleet-deployment as GUIDE, or (c) remove. H1 retained until disposition decided.

**Open — `applications/user-guide-2026-03-30-v2.md`:** no frontmatter, uses `# Part I:` / `# Part II:` as chapter markers. Needs classification pass.

### 2026-05-06 — Phase D + E batch (project-editorial)

Phase D: 28 Spanish strategic-adaptation pairs committed across architecture/, governance/, services/, systems/. Phase E: bcsc_class + status sweep — 213 files total.

### 2026-05-06 — GIS service topics + design-system/ category (project-editorial)

Commits 4d5a499 + 0bf2f6d: GIS service topics, app-orchestration-gis bilingual pair, design-system/ category (30 files — 6 foundation TOPICs + 16 component guides). Named competitor references stripped per C15 decision.

### 2026-04-30 — Wikipedia normalization pass + 5 architecture/reference TOPIC pairs

40 root topic-*.md files normalized (frontmatter, quality grades, See Also, References, body H1 removed). 5 new bilingual pairs committed to `architecture/` and `reference/`.

**Open:** 40 root topic-*.md files remain at root (legacy flat-at-root). Category migration (topic-*.md → category subdirectories) pending — naming-convention.md §10 now ratified (2026-05-07), unblocking migration.

**Open:** `topic-compounding-substrate.md` at root is superseded by `architecture/compounding-substrate.md`. Retire at next migration pass.

### 2026-04-28 — 12 bilingual TOPIC pairs + rename + deletions (project-language)

12 bilingual TOPIC pairs committed at repo root. `topic-service-parser` renamed to `topic-service-extraction`. `README-pointsav-wiki.md` deleted (commit 6c1b178).

**Open:** category migration for these root-pattern files — pending (migration unblocked as of 2026-05-07 ratification).

### 2026-04-27 — Phase 4 + Part D + style-guide TOPICs (project-language, 3 sessions)

14 bilingual TOPIC pairs added at repo root: Phase 4 substrate-explainers, Part D apprenticeship/compounding/contributor-model, style-guide-readme/topic/guide pairs.

**Open:** category migration for all these root-pattern files (unblocked 2026-05-07). `topic-contributor-model.md` is canonical form (not `topic-four-tier-contributor-model.md`).

### 2026-04-23 — Migration to contract-conforming layout

Normalisation pass required: add `index.md` at root, create category directories, move legacy `topic-*.md` / `TOPIC-*.md` / `TOPIC_*.md` files into categories normalising to lowercase kebab, write `_index.md` per category, rewrite wikilinks. Sequencing: migrate one category at a time. Category taxonomy now ratified (2026-05-07).

### 2026-04-23 — YAML-only structured records need classification

Root-level files without Markdown bodies: `sys-adr-06.yaml` … `sys-adr-19.yaml` (11 files → `governance/`), `service-*-01.yaml` (4 files → pair with `services/<name>.md`), `os-workplace-01.yaml` (→ `architecture/`), 3 `topic-*.yaml` files (→ pair with topic articles). No migrations executed yet.

### 2026-04-23 — Filename-case normalisation

Three conventions coexist at root: `topic-*.md`, `TOPIC-*.md`, `TOPIC_*.md`. Rename to lowercase kebab as part of category-migration pass above.

### 2026-04-23 — `RESEARCH-BIM-MARKET.md` classification needed

Untracked file at repo root dated 2026-04-22. Decision needed: wiki article, internal-only (do not commit), or different repo? Hold until classified.

### 2026-04-23 — `app-mediakit-knowledge.zip` cross-repo handoff

Untracked ZIP at root. Handoff entry open in `handoffs-outbound.md` — destination `pointsav-monorepo`. Delete local ZIP once destination commit lands.

### 2026-04-23 — `upstream` remote is a legacy artefact

`git remote remove upstream` pending explicit operator approval (non-destructive; points to pointsav-monorepo which is not this repo's flow).
