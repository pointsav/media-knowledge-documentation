Inbound email enters the PointSav platform at a single, auditable point — **service-email** authenticates against the Microsoft 365 mailbox via the Microsoft Graph API, retrieves inbound messages, and writes raw payloads to a local queue without interpreting content. Ring 2 services handle everything downstream. The service deliberately maintains no knowledge of message content or semantic meaning: its only job is reliable, authenticated extraction across the cloud boundary, so that content processing is confined to the platform's own compute.

## Architectural Baseline

The service addresses a structural limitation of IMAP and SMTP: both protocols require maintaining a persistent connection and expose message state management through legacy mechanisms. service-email uses OAuth2 authentication against the Microsoft Graph API instead, making each polling cycle a discrete, authenticated HTTP exchange. This approach confines the cloud-trust boundary to a single well-defined point in the pipeline.

## Ring and Role

service-email occupies **Ring 1 — Boundary Ingest** in the three-ring architecture. Ring 1 services are per-tenant and implement an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server interface. Each Ring 1 service handles one inbound channel; service-email handles the email channel. Other Ring 1 services cover filesystem, people records, and structured input. No Ring 1 service processes content semantically — that is Ring 2's scope.

## Structural Organization of Components

The extraction loop operates in three steps:

1. **Authenticate.** An OAuth2 handshake against the Microsoft Graph API produces a bearer token scoped to mail read operations for the configured mailbox.
2. **Extract.** The service polls for unread messages (excluding drafts stored only in the local UI). It retrieves the raw OData JSON payload for each message found.
3. **Write and mark.** The payload is written to the local temporary queue at `assets/tmp-maildir/`. The service then issues an authorized `PATCH` request to mark each extracted message as read on the remote server, preventing re-extraction on the next polling cycle.

The service surrenders execution to the downstream parser (`service-extraction`) once the payload lands in the queue. No parsing, classification, or content inspection occurs within service-email.

## Configuration

| Parameter | Purpose |
|---|---|
| OAuth2 credentials | Client ID and secret for the registered Microsoft Graph application |
| Mailbox address | The Microsoft 365 mailbox to monitor |
| Poll interval | How often the extraction loop runs |
| Queue path | Local filesystem path for the temporary maildir queue |
