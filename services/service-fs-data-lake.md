`service-fs` is the foundational storage layer for the PointSav GIS platform. It implements a data lake model where raw geospatial points ingested from open geospatial sources are stored in a durable, modular file system for downstream analytical processing.

## Data Ingestion and Storage

The service maintains a unified filesystem structure with separate landing zones for retail and civic infrastructure data.

- **Retail landing:** raw commercial operator records ingested from open geospatial registries (OpenStreetMap, Overture Maps Foundation).
- **Civic landing:** raw civic and institutional facility records from the same open sources.

### Architectural Role

As the stateful layer of the platform, `service-fs` is responsible for data persistence. It is designed to be independent of the analytical software — if the GIS orchestration layer is re-provisioned, the core data assets remain intact within this layer. The clean separation between data persistence and analytical logic is a core design invariant.

## Unikernel Implementation

In production, `service-fs` is deployed as a low-overhead unikernel. It provides a restricted API for the `service-business` and `service-places` intelligence layers to read raw data and write back processed results, enforcing clean separation between storage and analysis concerns.
